## Usage
#### Creational Patterns
In creational patterns, all five patterns will be implemented with the same example to make it easy to compare.  
Below is the structure of the example to help understand easier and faster:  
- Final product: Computer  
- Parts of computer: Mouse, Keyboard, Screen  
- Styles of computer(or parts): Windows, Mac  

Below is the key point of view in each pattern in my own opinion:  
1. Abstract Factory: Define an abstract factory interface to **produce a whole family of products**
2. Builder: Define a builder interface to **build parts of product and return it at final**
3. Factory Method: Define a more specific factory interface(than abstract factory) to **produce a specific product**
4. Prototype: Define a prototype for clients to **clone to use**
5. Singleton:
