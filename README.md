# Computer Science Basic Demonstration

## Preface
#### There are five topics in this repository: ####
1. Data Structure:
   - Different implementations of data structures(e.g. using **array** and **linked-list** to implement stack)
   - Basic operations of data structures including **access**, **search**, **insert**, **delete**;  
     Average and Worst time complexity are remarked in every operation functions;
   - Very simple test for four operations in every `[data_structure].py` file;
2. Sorting Algorithms:
   - Only focus on array sorting algorithms(e.g. **Quick Sort**, **Merge Sort**, **Heap Sort**, ..., etc.)
   - Maybe it will include some other sorting algorithms in the future;
3. Algorithms:
   - Only focus on scheduling problems and their variants;
   - According to different 
4. LeetCode: 
   - Randomly choose the problems with different difficulties :)
   - Maybe I will organize the problems into different features...?  
     (e.g. Dynamic Programming as a topic)
   - Every problem will only be solved with my first thought and one of the best solutions.
   - Most important of all, there are lots of complete solutions everywhere on the Internet, this is just for myself to prepare for the interview.
5. Design Patterns:
   - Implementations 23 design patterns summarized in ***&lt;&lt;Design Patterns - Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software&gt;&gt;***
## Purpose
#### There are two main purposes as follows:  
1. I just prepare the coding interview for myself.
2. I want to save some code(or some projects) not only on my PC.

So the structure of this repository is not so completed.  
Maybe in the future I will have a more organizational tutorials maybe not :).


## Usage
1. Data Structure:  
you can run every `[data_structure].py` file independently and see the results of four operations.  
e.g. Array:
```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

    print(access(array, 3))
    print(search(array, 3))
    print(insert(array, index=1, value=10))
    print(delete(array, value=10))
```

2. Sorting Algorithms:
3. Algorithms:
4. LeetCode:
5. Design Patterns:

**NOTE: There are more detailed usage tutorials in every topic.**
